## Getting Started
1. Download the latest chrome driver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

1.0. You can either add the chrome driver and chrome.exe to your PATH or just pass in both of their paths as arguments when constructing a new `ChromeDriver`

1.1. (Optional) Move the chrome driver where ever you'd like and add it to your PATH environment variable

1.2 (Optional) Add the path to your chrome.exe to your PATH environment variable

3. Run main and ensure chromium starts up, goes to an online store, and console prints out whether or not a product is in stock
